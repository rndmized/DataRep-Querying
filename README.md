#### Data Representation and Querying Project 2016

This repository contains code and information for a third-year undergraduate project for the module **Data Representation and Querying**.
The module is taught to undergraduate students at [GMIT](http://www.gmit.ie) in the Department of Computer Science and Applied Physics.
The lecturer is [Ian McLoughlin](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io).

### Project Overview
I have created a Single-Page Web Application (SPA) that lets users create character sheet or Dungeons and Dragons (the pen and paper game).Initially, I intended to create a full-blown game, but the scope of the project proved to be way to ambitious so I decided to do something more achievable and that I can ue.

The project was guided by the following excerpt from the project instructions:
>You are required to develop a single-page web application(SPA) written in the programming language Python using the Flask framework. You must devise an idea for a web application, write the software, write documentation explaining how the application works, and write a short user guide for it.

### How to run the application
The application is written using the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) library in [Python 3](https://www.python.org).
Both must be installed to run the project.

I use the [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) package for persistence in the application.
This must also be installed.
However, no further configuration our setup is required, as the database is fully contained in the db directory in this repository.

Once these prerequisites are installed, the application can be run locally:
```bash
$ python webapp.py
```
Once the application is running, it can be accessed by pointing your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ .

### Architecture
This web application runs in [Python 3](https://www.python.org) using the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) web micro-framework and uses mongoDB as a database.
Python 3 and Flask were requirements for the project, but mongoDB was selected by its ease of use.
